Basic Exercises in Navbar, Props etc
I'm currently working from the standalone2.html
to render the navBarRemoveEx02.jsx file, to allow a minstock to be set, so their are always a certain number of items for display

to check this out either use a live server or

rename standalone2 file to index.html
then in the terminal
npm install --global http-server
http-server -c -1
